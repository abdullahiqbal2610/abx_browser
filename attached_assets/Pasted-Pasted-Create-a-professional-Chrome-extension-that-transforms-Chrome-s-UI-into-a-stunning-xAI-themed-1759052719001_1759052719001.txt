Create a professional Chrome extension that transforms Chrome's UI into a stunning xAI-themed experience with mind-blowing animations. This should be deployment-ready quality.
PROJECT SCOPE:
Build a complete Chrome extension using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no external APIs needed) that redesigns Chrome's interface with xAI's aesthetic and animations.
CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

Custom New Tab Page

Replace Chrome's default new tab with xAI-style design
Animated particle background (like xAI welcome page)
Clean search bar with smooth animations
Personalized greeting with user input
Quick access bookmarks grid


xAI Theme System

Deep black backgrounds (#0a0a0a)
Clean white text and accents
Smooth animations and transitions
Modern typography (system fonts)
Particle effects /floating elements / on hover animations / revolving objects


Advanced Animations (Replit can handle):

CSS keyframes for smooth transitions
JavaScript-powered particle systems
Floating elements with mouse interaction
Smooth fade-in/fade-out effects
Parallax scrolling effects
Glowing hover effects


Google Services Integration (if possible with Chrome APIs):

Gmail badge counter (using Chrome's built-in capabilities)
Google Calendar quick view
Google Classroom notifications
Chrome bookmarks integration
Chrome history quick access


Customization Features:

Toggle animations on/off
Personalize greeting message
Customize quick access links
Theme intensity controls
Layout preferences



TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Use Manifest V3 for Chrome extension
Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no external libraries unless built-in)
Optimized performance (60fps animations)
Responsive design for all screen sizes
Clean, professional code structure

FILE STRUCTURE NEEDED:

manifest.json
newtab.html (custom new tab page)
styles.css (xAI theme + animations)
script.js (functionality + animations)
background.js (Chrome extension logic)
popup.html/popup.js (extension settings)

DESIGN INSPIRATION:
Create animations and aesthetics similar to xAI's website - floating particles, smooth transitions, modern minimalist design with stunning visual effects.
Make this extension so visually impressive and functionally smooth that it could compete with top Chrome Web Store extensions. Focus on what Replit can build excellently without external API dependencies.
also key note, make it dark, sci-fi, look major colour palette should be jet black, and white, 
add illuminating star light effct too(violet blueish white light), like a pulsating star
